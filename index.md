### CPSC 120

* Lab 4
    Part 1 was an enjoyable experience for me as it was the first time I used separate function source code and combined it with the main function. It felt like solving a puzzle as I traced the code patiently and figured out which function I needed to write. It was satisfying to see the various functions work together seamlessly, and I appreciated the importance of organizing code into separate functions for clarity and maintainability.

* Lab 9 
    Part 1, I learned how to use the <fstream> library to extract specific data from a large dataset, which was a dictionary in this case. I was excited to fill a vector with the extracted data and use it for further analysis. This experience taught me the importance of knowing how to access and manipulate data in different file formats.

* Lab 11
    Part 1 was a significant learning experience for me as I was introduced to the concept of "class." I found it fascinating to learn how to construct a class and understand its components, which allowed me to use it efficiently in the main function. This experience taught me how classes can be useful in organizing and encapsulating data and functionality in programming projects.
